# 3D Models

v1.4 of the RB represents the most recent version of the prototype.

Last version of assembly with mock-up of services (slightly out of date):
- Fiber bundles routed on top of RB, d=2mm (blue)
- BV routed on top of power board, d=2.33mm (yellow)
- DSS cables (temperature sensors) routed on top of PB, but can be moved depending on where the sensors eventually go. d=1mm (blue)
- LV cables: v3 of the layout assumes ganging of two power boards, reducing the number of cables. A LV busbar is currently also under discussion. d=1.5mm (red)
